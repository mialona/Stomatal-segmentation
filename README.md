# Stomatal segmentation using deep learning techniques
 Final degree project in which computer vision or artificial vision has been applied, specifically various deep learning techniques, to develop a program that allows the semantic segmentation of images of stomata of various plants.
 
- **E01**: Program responsible for the generation of stomatal images from XML files and their corresponding "raw" images and for the semi-automatic creation of masks using different configurations of image treatment techniques.
- **E02**: Neat set of images and their respective masks. Divided into a training set and another set for the evaluation of results.
- **E03**: Workbooks and models resulting from learning according to the different defined architectures.
- **E04**: Application that allows the use and comparison of the obtained models in a simple way.
